## Currently Learning ðŸ“š

### Advanced Event Handling (Confidence: 3/5)
- **Event bubbling and propagation**: Understanding stopPropagation, nested event listeners
- **Complex interaction patterns**: Multiple handlers on nested elements, preventing conflicts
- **Form interaction management**: Preventing unwanted triggers while maintaining usability

### Advanced JavaScript Patterns (Confidence: 2/5)
- **Module organization**: How to structure larger JavaScript applications
- **Error handling**: Beyond basic validation to robust error management
- **Asynchronous programming**: Understanding callbacks, promises (upcoming need)

### Application Architecture (Confidence: 2/5)
- **Component reusability**: How to build UI elements that work in multiple contexts
- **State management**: Coordinating data changes across different UI components
- **Performance considerations**: Handling larger datasets efficiently
- **Container-based architecture**: Using container elements to separate content from display/layout logic
- **Relationship patterns**: Flat storage with references vs hierarchical nesting for element relationships

### Linking & Relationship Systems (Confidence: 1/5)
- **Text parsing for links**: `@references` and `[[links]]` detection and processing
- **Relationship discovery**: Finding connections between elements automatically
- **Navigation patterns**: How links should behave in different contexts

## Upcoming Learning Goals ðŸŽ¯

### Immediate (Next 2 sessions)
- **Functional linking**: Make parsed `@references` and `[[links]]` navigate between notes
- **Additional element types**: Implement titleless 'snippet' type with auto-generated titles
- **UI refinements**: Improve edit mode styling, better visual feedback

### Short-term (Next 2-4 weeks)
- **Relationship visualization**: Show connections between elements visually
- **Export functionality**: Generate JSON and Markdown from element data
- **Enhanced UI interactions**: Hover effects, progressive disclosure patterns

### Medium-term (Phase 1.5)
- **Modal content viewers**: Display full element content in popup windows
- **Preview systems**: Hover-based quick previews of linked content
- **Template systems**: Customizable preview formats for different element types

## Skill Connections & Insights

### Key Learning Pattern
**Manual implementation + conceptual explanation** produces much better retention than watching AI generate code. The physical act of typing combined with understanding "why" creates lasting knowledge.

### Architecture Understanding
The **element-based data model** connects everything: storage, display, linking, and future AI features all work with the same flexible structure. This foundational choice supports all planned features.

### CSS & JavaScript Integration
Understanding how **CSS classes control visibility** (`.hidden`) and how **JavaScript manipulates classes** (`classList.add/remove`) bridges styling and interactivity effectively.

### File Organization Benefits
**Separation of concerns** makes debugging much easier - can isolate problems to specific files and understand the data flow between components.

### Data Architecture Complexity
Studying other tools (Tana, Obsidian, Notion) revealed that **real-time text parsing** (like @mentions) involves sophisticated speculative execution and state management - much more complex than initially apparent.

### Container Architecture Breakthrough
**Separating content from display logic** via container base types creates clean separation where books/notes handle their data while containers handle layout/positioning - prevents properties object from becoming unwieldy.

### Event Handling Mastery
**Event bubbling understanding** is crucial for complex UIs. Learning when to use `stopPropagation()` and how to structure nested event listeners prevents unexpected behaviors and creates intuitive interactions.

### Helper Function Pattern
**Extracting reusable logic** into helper functions (like `addLinkHandlers()`) reduces duplication and makes code more maintainable. This pattern scales well as applications grow in complexity.
