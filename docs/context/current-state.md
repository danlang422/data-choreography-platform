# Current Development State

**Last Updated**: August 11, 2025
**Session**: 3 (Note Editing Implementation)

## Current Focus Area
Phase 1 MVP nearing completion with full note editing functionality implemented. Ready to tackle linking system or additional element types.

## Active Files & Status

### Application Code (85% Phase 1 Complete)
- **`index.html`**: Complete app shell with modal structure and semantic HTML
- **`css/styles.css`**: Professional styling with organized sections, hover effects, responsive design
- **`js/app.js`**: Main application logic, modal controls, note display functionality
- **`js/dataModel.js`**: Core data structure following spec exactly, localStorage persistence
- **`js/capture.js`**: Form handling, validation, note creation workflow

### Documentation Framework (In Progress)
- **`docs/planning/app-vision.md`**: ‚úÖ Complete - extracted from specification document
- **`docs/planning/feature-roadmap.md`**: ‚úÖ Complete - planned phases without progress mixing
- **`docs/context/architecture-decisions.md`**: ‚úÖ Complete - technical choices with rationale
- **`docs/context/current-state.md`**: üöß Creating now
- **`docs/context/learning-progress.md`**: üöß Next to create
- **`docs/progress/milestones.md`**: ‚è∏Ô∏è Pending archive decision
- **`docs/progress/session-logs/`**: ‚è∏Ô∏è Pending session log from previous attempt

## Working Features
- **Note Creation**: Modal form with validation, saves to localStorage
- **Note Editing**: Click-to-edit with in-place form, save/cancel functionality
- **Note Display**: Professional list view with titles, content, metadata, parsed links
- **Data Persistence**: Survives browser refresh, proper JSON serialization, updates preserved
- **User Interface**: Responsive design, hover effects, smooth interactions
- **Error Handling**: Basic validation with user feedback
- **Event Management**: Proper event bubbling control, multiple nested event handlers

## Immediate Next Steps (Phase 1 Completion)
1. **Implement functional linking** - make parsed `@references` and `[[links]]` navigate between notes
2. **Add additional element types** - explore titleless 'snippet' type
3. **Grid view option** - alternative to list display
4. **Basic relationship discovery** - find connections through links
5. **UI refinements** - improve edit mode styling and interactions

## Context for AI
**Learning Goal**: Complete Phase 1 foundation while establishing sustainable documentation practices
**Current Understanding**: Strong grasp of HTML/CSS/JS file organization, data modeling, localStorage, complex event handling patterns, form data extraction, object updates
**Preferred Teaching Style**: Manual coding with chunked explanations, understanding verification at each step
**Implementation Status**: Core CRUD operations complete, ready for linking system and type expansion

## Questions/Blockers
- **Archive strategy**: How to handle milestones/documentation from previous development attempt?
- **Session continuity**: Best approach for preserving context across conversation restarts?
- **Documentation maintenance**: Balance between comprehensive tracking and practical usability?

## Development Environment
- **Local directory**: `C:\data-choreography\`
- **Editor**: VS Code with file navigation practice
- **Browser testing**: Direct file opening, no build tools
- **Context preservation**: Claude Project framework + local documentation system

## Recent Breakthroughs
- **Manual coding approach**: Discovered significantly better learning outcomes vs AI code generation
- **Documentation separation**: Clean distinction between planning, progress tracking, and current context
- **Architecture confidence**: Understanding file relationships and data flow patterns
