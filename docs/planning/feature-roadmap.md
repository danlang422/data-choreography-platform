# Data Choreography Platform - Feature Roadmap

**Created**: August 7, 2025
**Purpose**: Planned implementation sequence and feature dependencies

## Phase 1: Foundation (MVP)
**Goal**: Functional manual system with learning-ready architecture

### Core Features
- Basic element system with flexible properties
- Simple capture and manual organization
- Basic text-based linking with `@references` and `[[links]]` (navigation only)
- List and basic grid views
- Local storage (browser localStorage/IndexedDB)
- Data structured to support enhanced interactions (version tracking, component reusability)
- Basic export functionality (JSON, Markdown)

### Success Criteria
- Can create, store, and retrieve elements reliably
- Links between elements work for navigation
- Multiple view formats display same data
- Code is understandable and modifiable by developer
- Performance good with 100+ elements

---

## Phase 1.5: Enhanced Link Interaction
**Goal**: Rich content interaction without complexity of full inline editing

### Core Features
- Hover preview system for all reference types
- Modal popup content viewer with scrolling and basic interaction
- Progressive disclosure controls (expand/collapse sections)
- Visual feedback for link relationships
- Preview template system for custom types

### Success Criteria
- Link interactions feel intuitive and responsive
- Previews provide useful information without navigation
- Modal viewing supports research workflows
- No performance degradation with complex content

---

## Phase 2: Core Functionality & Inline Editing
**Goal**: Full manual workflow with contextual content manipulation

### Core Features
- Full inline editing system for references
- Custom type creation (Type Designer interface)
- Advanced views (kanban, calendar, timeline)
- Multi-context state synchronization
- Edit conflict resolution interface
- Relationship discovery and unlinked mentions
- Manual tidying/organization workflows
- Web capture (internal link processing)
- Progressive Web App (PWA) setup

### Success Criteria
- Inline editing feels as responsive as native text editing
- Custom types function identically to system types
- Multi-context editing maintains data integrity
- Relationship discovery finds meaningful connections

---

## Phase 3: Enhanced Interface & Multi-Context Features
**Goal**: Highly customizable, multi-modal interface with transclusion

### Core Features
- Transclusion-style embedding with bidirectional editing
- Advanced UI customization (visual styling controls)
- Multiple interface modes (spatial, daily note, dashboard, research)
- Browser extension for web capture with link integration
- View customization (drag grid edges, adjust layouts)
- Mobile-responsive design and PWA features
- Research mode with optimized link-heavy workflows

### Success Criteria
- Multiple interface modes serve different use cases
- Customization feels intuitive and maintains consistency
- Cross-platform functionality works seamlessly
- Research workflows significantly enhanced

---

## Phase 4: AI Integration
**Goal**: Intelligent automation of manual workflows with context awareness

### Core Features
- AI-assisted tidying with learning capabilities across contexts
- Conversational AI queries ("show me all logos for Acme client")
- Smart content discovery (auto-suggest tasks from text, extract images)
- Proactive assistance (resurface dormant ideas, suggest connections)
- AI-powered link suggestion and relationship discovery

### Success Criteria
- AI assistance enhances rather than replaces user control
- Learning adapts to user patterns without manual configuration
- Suggestions are contextually relevant and useful
- Privacy and data ownership maintained

---

## Phase 5: External Integration & Sync
**Goal**: Multi-device, multi-platform data choreography

### Core Features
- External API connections with visual mapping
- Sync service for multi-device access with conflict resolution
- Custom widget creation for external data
- Advanced data choreography features
- Collaborative editing with multi-user synchronization

### Success Criteria
- External data integrates seamlessly with manual data
- Multi-device sync preserves all functionality
- Collaborative features maintain individual user agency
- System scales to team/organizational use

---

## Key Design Principles (Consistent Across All Phases)

- **Everything is an element** - consistent data model across all features
- **Base types provide semantic context** - especially for AI understanding
- **Relationships emerge from content** - through link parsing and user creation
- **Views are flexible representations** - same data, multiple presentations
- **User-defined equals system-defined** - no second-class custom types
- **Local-first, sync-enhanced** - works offline, better online
- **Progressive enhancement** - simple foundation, sophisticated features layered on

---

## Dependencies & Sequencing Rationale

**Why Phase 1 before 1.5**: Need basic linking infrastructure before enhanced interactions
**Why 1.5 before Phase 2**: Learn interaction patterns before complex inline editing
**Why Phase 2 before 3**: Need stable editing before advanced UI customization
**Why Phase 4 after 2-3**: AI works best with established user patterns and data
**Why Phase 5 last**: External integration requires mature local functionality
