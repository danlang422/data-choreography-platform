# Data Choreography Platform - App Vision

## Core Vision

A flexible workspace where users capture, connect, and choreograph their data. Beyond manual capture, users can pull in data from any API source (calendar, email, social, project tools) and design custom interfaces to display and interact with that information. AI assists in organizing, connecting, and surfacing relevant data across all sources.

## Key Differentiators

- **AI-assisted "tidying"** that learns user patterns across all data sources
- **API choreography** - not just triggering other apps, but designing custom interfaces for your data
- **Contextual content interaction** - references that can be previewed, edited inline, and work across contexts
- **Obsidian-style relationship discovery** with atomic-style content manipulation
- **WYSIWYG workspace design** - users build their ideal dashboard/interface
- **Unified capture system** for both manual input and automated data ingestion
- **True type equality** - custom types function identically to system types (Fibery-like, not Notion-like)

## Development Philosophy

- **Local-first** - works perfectly offline, sync enhances but doesn't replace
- **Learning-focused** - built incrementally with full understanding at each step
- **User ownership** - users control their data, interface, and AI behavior
- **Understanding over speed** - every feature implemented should be something the developer can explain, modify, and extend independently

## Primary User: Jay Persona

**Profile**: 42-year-old marketing professional and parent who manages multiple information streams across personal and professional domains.

**Core Workflow**: Capture → Tidy → Organize → Connect → Display → Interact

**Key Needs**:
- Quick capture without interrupting flow
- AI assistance that learns organizational patterns
- Custom object types for specialized work (logos, spices, standards)
- Cross-domain connections between personal and professional
- Flexible views of the same data (lists, grids, kanban, calendar)

## Success Vision

### Technical Success
- All features work reliably with test data
- Code is well-organized and documented
- System performance remains good with realistic data loads
- Data integrity maintained across all operations

### Learning Success
- User can explain the architecture and data flow
- User can make small modifications independently
- User understands why specific technical choices were made
- User feels confident about the code quality and security

### Product Success
- System solves real problems in user's workflow
- Interface feels natural and efficient
- Features integrate well together
- System can be extended for new use cases

## Long-term Capabilities (Design For, Implement Later)

### Enhanced Content Interaction
- Smart sectioning with AI-identified logical content sections
- Version branching with divergent edits and merge options
- Context-aware editing with different capabilities based on display context
- Multi-user real-time collaboration

### Emergent Element Discovery
- Inline images auto-create File elements
- Task-like text suggests Task element creation
- System recognizes patterns and suggests extractions
- User controls auto-discovery preferences

### Advanced AI Features
- Proactive suggestion system with cross-context understanding
- Learning user patterns for better organization
- Cross-domain relationship suggestions enhanced by usage patterns
- Content enhancement and tagging with context awareness

### Collaboration & Sharing
- Shared workspaces with preserved link interactions
- Export to multiple formats while maintaining relationships
- Template sharing with interaction patterns included

**Core Principle**: Technology serving human connection and authentic organization, never replacing or commodifying meaningful relationships.
